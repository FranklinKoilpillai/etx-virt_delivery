# Create a Red Hat Developer account

The **ETX Virtualization Delivery** workshop requires every attendee to have a
Red Hat account in order to access certain Red Hat software.  It is strongly
recommended that all attendees create a Red Hat developer account for use
during the workshop.  This is true even for attendees that have one or more
existing Red Hat accounts.

If desired, a service such as [GMail](https://gmail.com) can be used to create a
new (possibly temporary) email address to avoid interfering with any existing
Red Hat logins.

1. Navigate to https://developer.redhat.com.

1. Click on the **Join Red Hat Developer** button.

1. *But wait, there's more!!!*

   Before using the new account to access Red Hat software, you must log in to
   the [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and answer some
   additional questions.  Once you have provided all of the required information
   (which may change as you fill out the form) click on the **Submit** button.

1. You should be taken to the Customer Portal home page, and your name should
   be displayed.  Your account is now (finally!) ready to be used when Red Hat
   credentials are required during the workshop.
