# Running a migration

Once the migration playbooks are in place and the prepare configuration is done we cna finally run a migration.

To run a migration we need to prepare an inventory file that will contain the list of VMs to migrate.

This migration will be run on two windows machines:
- ETX/student-[student_id]/winweb01
- ETX/student-[student_id]/win2019

The inventory file should look like this:

```yaml

TODO
```

Then we can run the migration playbook with this command:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts playbooks/run-migration.yml
```

or we can activate the playbook from the AAP UI, by navigating here:

Follow the migration progress in MTV UI by navigating to this link: TODO


## Verify the outcome of the migration

Verify that the migration was successful by connecting into the migrated VMs.
