# Migration Factory Installation

This module is about installing and creating the initial configuration of the migration factory.
To be more precise we assume that OpenShift clusters are already created and configured via GitOps.
In this module we are going to deploy AAP and prepare it to run the migration factory playbooks.


[NOTE]
====
There will be situations in which customers already have instances of AAP deployed. In those cases you just have to configure those instances to run the migration factory playbooks.
This behavior is driven via inventory parameters.
====

## Deploying AAP

Examine this inventory needed to deploy AAP:

```yaml
lorem ipsum...
```

configure the inventory for you cluster, by changing this file [<file-link>]

Run the playbook with this command

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts playbooks/deploy-aap.yml
```


## Verify the installation

Verify that AAP was correctly deployed by navigating to this URL: `https://aap.apps.<cluster-domain>`

Login in using the administrator account.

Verify that the migration factory playbooks have be configured, you should see the following:
