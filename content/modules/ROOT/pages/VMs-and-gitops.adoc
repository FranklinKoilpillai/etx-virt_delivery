# VMs and gitops

In this exercise we will create VMs and pods using gitops. We will also configure a network policy to control the traffic between the VM and the pod.

## Install the gitops Operator

This Openshift environment does not have ArgoCD already deployed. So we have to deploy it.
Run the following commands:

```sh
oc apply -f content/gitops/bootstrap/argocd.yaml
oc apply -f content/gitops/bootstrap/cluster-role-binding.yaml
```

## Deploy the ArgoCD Instance

Let's deploy the ArgoCD instance. In this case we are going to deploy teh default argocd instance, but in a rel world scenario , you might have to design for multitenancy, in which case you might end up needing more than one instance. Run the following command:

```sh
export gitops_repo=<the url to this repo are using in the *.git format>
export cluster_base_domain=$(oc get ingress.config.openshift.io cluster --template={{.spec.domain}} | sed -e "s/^apps.//")
export platform_base_domain=${cluster_base_domain#*.}
envsubst < content/gitops/bootstrap/argocd.yaml | oc apply -f -
```

## Deploy the gitops root Application

We are going to deploy two applications in the same namespace: one VM and one pod. The pod will be able to talk to the VM, but the VM will not be able to talk to the pod.

To do so we are going to employ the https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/cluster-bootstrapping/#app-of-apps-pattern[app of apps pattern]. In this pattern, we have a root application that deploys other applications. 

The root application will look for applications to deploy in the `content/gitops/applications` directory.

Deploy the root application by running the following command:

```sh
envsubst < content/gitops/bootstrap/appset.yaml | oc apply -f -
```

Notice that we have implemented the app of apps pattern with the an https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/[ApplicationSet].

## Verify the deployed applications and traffic policies

Examine the network policies that were created:
1. the nginx pod only accepts traffic from the openshift-ingress namespace. This means that we can create a route for it.
2. the apache VM only accepts traffic from pods in the same namespace, including the nginx pod.

run the following commands to start httpd on the VM after connecting to the console

```sh
sudo su -l  # to become root
dnf install -y httpd
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd
```

now the VM is listening on port 80

from the laptop, run the following command to get service IPs:

```sh
export nginx_ip=$(oc get svc nginx -n gitops-test -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')
export apache_ip=$(oc get svc apache -n gitops-test -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')
```

Let's verify that the nginx pod can talk to the apache VM:

```sh
export nginx_pod_name=$(oc get pod -n gitops-test -l app=nginx -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
oc exec -n gitops-test $nginx_pod_name -- curl -s http://${apache_ip}:80
```

Let's verify that the apache VM cannot talk to the nginx pod:

First let's retrieve the IP of the nginx service:

```sh
echo $nginx_ip
```

Then from the machine console run the following command:

```sh
curl -v http://${nginx_ip}:8080
```
