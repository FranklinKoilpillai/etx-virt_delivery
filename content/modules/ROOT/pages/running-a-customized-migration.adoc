# Running  a customized migration playbook

In this lab we will run the migration playbook with the customization that was developed in the previous lab on a different set of VMs.

## Prepare the inventory file

prepare the inventory file as before, but this time add a reference to the mutate mac address playbook in the field for the post migrations steps. here is an example:

```yaml
TODO
```

Add the RHEL9 VMs to this migration wave.

## Run the migration playbook

As before, you can run the playbook either by using the command line or by using the AAP UI.

## Verify that the migration was successful

Verify that the MAC addresses of the VMs were changed and that the VMs were able to start correctly and connect to the network.

You cna go to this VM network detail page to very tht the MAC address was changed: 

TODO
mage::running-a-customized-migration/migrated-vm.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

and you can ssh into the VMs to verify that they started correclty.
