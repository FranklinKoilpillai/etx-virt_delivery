# Troubleshooting Migrations

In this lab we have a VM that cannot be migrated because it's hitting a limitation of MTV. The purpose of the lab is for the student to reason about different approaches on how to solve the issue.
This lab is optional, but differently from the other ones, it will not give you the solution to the problem.
The troublesome machine is teh following: `ETX/student-[student_id]/some.troubles.here` and contains two issues that prevents migration.
To verify that the machine has been migrated correctly, run this command from the machine:

```sh
curl localhost
```
you should see a simple "hello world" page as a response.

## Run the migration

create the migration inventory as follows with the problematic VM:

```yaml

TODO  
```

Run the migration playbook with the following command:

```sh 
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts playbooks/run-migration.yml
```

the migration should fail.

Understand the error message and try to solve the issue. Use your mates and the lab assistant to compare ideas and try solutions.
