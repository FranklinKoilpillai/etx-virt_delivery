# Troubeshooting Migrations

In this lab we have a VM that cannot be migrated because it's hitting a limitation of MTV. The purpose of the lab is for the student to reason about different approaches on how to solve the issue.
This lab is options, but differently from te other ones, it will not give you the solution to the problem.

## Run the migration

create the migration inventory as follows with the problematic VM:

```yaml

TODO  
```

Run the migration playbook with the following command:

```sh 
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts playbooks/run-migration.yml
```

the migration shoudl fail.

Understand the error message and try to solve the issue. Use your mates and the lab assistant to compare ideas and try solutions.
